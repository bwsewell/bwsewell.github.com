title: Why I'm leaving Facebook for good this time
---

**September 11, 2005**...

About three weeks into college, I made the decision to join Facebook.  The only online accounts I think I've had longer than Facebook are maybe my GoDaddy account and AOL instant messenger (which doesn't really count).

I've found it interesting that as Facebook has evolved, so has my use for it.  Even though most of the mundane features they've added since the "mini feed" in 2006 haven't really changed what Facebook is and always has been.

For the majority of my first month on Facebook, I did what the typical 18 year old college kid would do... friend every attractive girl you can find in a search.  I eventually stopped.

Then they released Facebook notes.  I sort of used it as a blog... which nobody read.

Then came the "social graph" announced at F8 in the Summer of 2007.  Watching Mark Zuckerberg's keynote was downright creepy and uncomfortbale to say the least.  Farmville never grew on me, and all those other damn Facebook apps never captured my attention.

I continued to use Facebook for the typical photo gallery posting and stupid status update that nobody cared about.  I guess I never really learned that nobody cares about the nuances of my everyday routine.  Too much noise.  The whole reason I've started this blog is to collect my thoughts that are actually worth something, not just crap like, "Heading to the Beach with Rob, Nikki, Kyle, and Brandon".  I'm going to devote my energy to creating something that's worth it... everything else I'll just continue to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bwsewell">tweet</a>.

So then I decided to give up Facebook for lent in 2009.  Gasp!  I know right.  Well, needless to say it wasn't that difficult.  I had sort of been on a Facebook hiatus for a while anyway, so the actual deactivation of my account didn't come as much of a shock.  It was actually really nice.  I stayed off for more than just 40 days too.  I eventually got back on a little while later and holy shit... the site looked completely different!  I had no clue what was going on and struggled to find out why my privacy settings had somehow been readjusted to some new defaults.

Then this damn timeline thing got released.

So why am I choosing to leave Facebook?

I've been trying to remember the last time Facebook improved my quality of life.  Not even drastically, but just something that Facebook did that made me say, "well, I'm sure glad I had Facebook".  I'm drawing a blank.  Twitter, on the other hand, has become my go-to social interation outlet.  I've been able to give feedback to companies, have quick conversations... the Belk Bowl even helped me get my tickets at will call in Charlotte after we forgot them at home all via Twitter.  But Facebook... nope.  Aside from finding out when my friends broke up with their girlfriends or boyfriends (which is useful information), there hasn't been anything there for me that has warranted me keeping my account.

**Things I won't miss about Facebook:**
<ul>
  <li>Getting one hundred emails about people wishing me a happy birthday</li>
  <li>Having to untag myself in photos of food or just the embarrassing/incriminating photos one of my friends tagged me in</li>
  <li>Listening to people complain about how you untagged yourself in some of their photos described above</li>
  <li>Being invited to "I lost my phone, give me your numbers" groups</li>
  <li>Changing my privacy settings 20 times a year</li>
  <li>Seeing people talk crap about people whom they know can see their Facebook page</li>
  <li>Seeing people talk crap about people whom they don't know can see their Facebook page</li>
  <li>Trying to decide what to make my profile picture</li>
  <li>Adjusting to a major interface overhaul</li>
  <li>The fat pile of dookie that is the Facebook App for iPhone</li>
</ul>

I can't pretend like everything about Facebook was horrible, otherwise I wouldn't have been on it this long... so to be fair...

**Things I will miss about Facebook:**
<ul>
  <li>Being able to easily get in touch with people who's email address I don't have</li>
  <li>Being able to "Login with Facebook" on sites that don't offer any alternative</li>
  <li>Losing almost 7 years of my documented life story</li>
  <li>Being reminded when it's a friend's birthday</li>
  <li>Inviting people to events</li>
  <li>Changing the site's language to "Pirate"</li>
</ul>

So I'm about to embark on this historic journey.  I've deactived my account probably 6 times now... and hopefully this time will be the last.  Wish me luck.

This all could have been avoided if only people with .edu addresses could sign up.

See you on Google Plus... SYKE!!!
