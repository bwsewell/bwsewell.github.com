title: Creating a Laravel App on AppFog
---

Back in December, I wrote a tutorial on [getting started with Codeigniter on Appfog](http://bwsewell.github.io/2012/12/18/creating_a_codeigniter_app_on_app_fog.html).  Here's a similar, but quicker tutorial on how to get up and running with Laravel on AppFog:

The `.htaccess` file you will need to place in your root directory looks like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/bwsewell/5971720.js"></script>

[Here's a tutorial](https://docs.appfog.com/services/mysql#php) on how to access MySQL connection information from AppFog in PHP.

If you're wondering how to setup PHPMyAdmin with your Laravel app, you can still follow the [same instructions form the Codeigniter tutorial](http://bwsewell.github.io/2012/12/18/creating_a_codeigniter_app_on_app_fog.html#phpmyadmin).
