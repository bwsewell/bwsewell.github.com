<h3>WTF is this?</h3>

<p>Please no... not another developer blog.  I've kept quiet on the interwebs for a while and stuck to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bwsewell">tweeting</a> almost exclusively.  Every time I attempt to start blogging again, I always stop within a month convincing myself nobody out there could possibly give a crap about what I do or think.  So please don't read any of this stuff if you don't want to.</p>
